# Flask Excel App Demo

This app is part of a demonstration showcasing the importance of learning to code and how advanced AI models like GPT can assist in the development process. The app demonstrates the power of procedural thinking in solving everyday problems using code. By using Python with Flask, HTML, and CSS, the app allows users to read and write data into an Excel file, showing how simple coding can be utilized to create useful applications. The intent is to illustrate how accessible programming has become, especially with tools like GPT to help automate parts of the development process.

## Overview of the Article

The article discusses how learning to code has become increasingly essential in the modern world and how tools like GPT can assist in creating and refining coding projects. GPT can generate functional code snippets, provide explanations, and streamline development tasks. This app, generated based on a simple prompt, showcases how GPT can help create practical solutions with minimal human input, demonstrating the future of coding assistance.

## Jupyter Notebook

You can **download the Jupyter notebook** provided with this app, which contains all the precise installation instructions, Python code, and HTML files necessary to run the app. With the notebook, you have two options:
1. **Directly run the app**: After downloading, you can follow the instructions in the notebook and run the app directly from your command line using `python`.
2. **Use it as a tutorial**: If you prefer a more hands-on learning experience, you can go through the code step-by-step to create the app from scratch on your own, using the notebook as a detailed guide.

## Complete Prompt:

"I need a complete Python Flask app that allows users to read and write data to an Excel file. The app should have an HTML front-end with some CSS styling. Here are the details:

1. **Python Functionality**: 
   - Use the `openpyxl` library to read from and write to an Excel file called `demo_excel_app.xlsx`.
   - The app should display data from the Excel file in an HTML table.
   - There should be a form that allows users to add new rows to the Excel file (fields: ID, Name, Age, Occupation).
   - There should be a link to download the updated Excel file.

2. **HTML and CSS**:
   - Style the page using CSS to create a modern look.
   - The table should have alternating row colours, and the form should be neatly laid out.
   - Include a hover effect for rows in the table and buttons for form submission.

3. **Instructions**:
   - Write installation instructions using `pip` to install the required libraries.
   - Provide command-line instructions to run the Flask app and how to open it in the browser.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The Python file should be named `demo_excel_app.py`.
   - The HTML template file should be stored in a `templates` folder as `index.html`.
   - Include clear comments in the Python and HTML files to explain the code."
